The World According to Sound

We’re a 90-second radio show that tells stories with sounds instead of, well, stories.

Each episode features a new sound and the story behind it. Sometimes the sounds come from things you’ve seen but never listened to: [bridges](https://soundcloud.com/worldaccordingtosound/4-bridge-songs), [muddy holes](https://soundcloud.com/worldaccordingtosound/1-mud-pots) in the ground, or [wifi networks](https://soundcloud.com/worldaccordingtosound/24-wifi). We’ve found sounds that [express data](https://soundcloud.com/worldaccordingtosound/20-wikipedia), tell a [piece of history](https://soundcloud.com/worldaccordingtosound/22hourcharm), and let you get inside [someone else’s head](https://soundcloud.com/worldaccordingtosound/5-auditory-hallucinations)–maybe someone’s head you don’t really want to be in.  Sometimes the sounds have surprising sources: [cult leaders](https://soundcloud.com/worldaccordingtosound/18-look-at-your-game-girl), [silent musicians](https://soundcloud.com/worldaccordingtosound/13-a-silent-song), or a [classics professor](https://soundcloud.com/worldaccordingtosound/16-the-iliad-1). Every episode features roughly thirty seconds of talking and sixty seconds of sound, and it’s best to listen with headphones, unless you have a sweet sound system.

We’re a public radio sound engineer and reporter in San Francisco, and all this started with the idea of making a radio show that didn’t tell you a story or what to think. We set out to create a show that is all about sound instead of language and narrative–a show where the point isn’t to hook you with a story, or to package up some quirky character you can admire, but to get deep into a sound and play a long, unnarrated stretch so you can really lose yourself. Maybe as you listen, your mind will start to wander; you might even experience a little [boredom](http://www.tc.umn.edu/~stou0046/kracauer)–that mortal sin of modern-day media. Don’t tell any of our radio friends, but we actually kind of like getting bored. Sometimes we get together and do it on weekends, that is, when we aren’t working on the show.

We hope you enjoy The World According to Sound and that it gets you to think a little bit about the world through your ears instead of your eyes. Thanks for listening!

    <h3>About The Live Show</h3>
    <p><a href='/'>The World According to Sound</a> is a radio show that airs on All Things Considered on NPR and weekly on individual public radio stations. The Washington Post writes that "each episode is 90 seconds, containing a neat little story about an evocative, unusual sound rendered in intense aural detail." HowSound deconstructed the show's sound-driven approach to radio in <a href='http://transom.org/2016/short-is-beautiful/'>a segment called "Short is Beautiful."</a>
    </p>
    <p>For the live version of the show, co-creators Chris Hoff and Sam Harnett set up a ring of speakers, pass out sleep shades, turn out the lights, and move sounds all around an audience seated in total darkness. In one hour they are going to take you on a trip where you will re-experience the world through your ears instead of just your eyes.</p>
